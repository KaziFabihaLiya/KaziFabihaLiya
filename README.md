# Hi there, I'm Liya! 👋

I'm a final-year Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) student at Independent University, Bangladesh, with a passion for blending tech innovation with creative design. As an aspiring software engineer, I love building user-friendly full-stack apps using MERN stacks, while exploring AI and machine learning to solve real-world problems—like empowering entrepreneurs or promoting eco-friendly initiatives. Currently, I'm gearing up for internships in fintech (fingers crossed for bKash!) and dreaming of scholarships abroad to dive deeper into motion graphics and animation. Let's connect and create something amazing together! 🌱✨
